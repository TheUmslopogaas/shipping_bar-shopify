# Shipping Bar Shopify
Created a custom shipping bar / moneyspent bar for shopify store. (Turbo Theme)
Made on top of turbo theme, so it'll require manual customization to work with other themes. 
Main feature is two step shipping discount. You can set two different discount amount. 

For instance, I can set $10 limit, meaning if someone buys something worth of $10 he'll get a gift or free shipping or whatever I might wanna offer.
Then, if he crosses the $10 limit, the bar will prompt a new information that if he buys things worthy of $20 or more, then he'll get an extra gift.

There might be some bugs, some not-so-good-looking elements. But that's not the focus. When I need any sort of shipping bar in shopify, i won't have to code from scratch.
